        What is Lorem Ipsum?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when <span class="loremHighlight">span unknown printer took a galley
            of type</span> and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
        also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
        the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.
